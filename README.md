# ExperimentierBreadboard-for-Raspberry-pi-pico
The project describes how to implement the suggestion in
https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/pico-datasheet.pdf on page 22. You need a Raspberry pi pico, half a standard breadboard, a charging board for a Li-Ion battery, a switch, a battery holder and a P-channel MOS transistor (IRF9540).
The holder for the circuit was created with OpenSCAD.
The source file and STI file are part of the project.
I give no guarantee that the project will work.
